Get alerts from Waze app's GeoJSON feed and store them in a database using CS50::query

# Crowdsourcing Pothole Reporting
The city of Providence, RI has recently gained access to a real-time feed of user-generated data from the popular community-based traffic/navigation application Waze.

This user-generated data, published as a GeoJSON stream which is refreshed every two minutes, represents an untapped resource of great potential.

Currently, the Providence Department of Public Works receives phone calls and PVD311 (a service provided by PublicStuff) alerts to determine where they need to patch potholes, with no input from the Waze application.

Our goal is to make the Waze data accessible to the Providence Department of Public Works, thus leveraging an app that citizens are already using to capture data they would otherwise have to report separately if they wanted to notify the DPW.

# July 2016: TechHire Code Sprint and Hackathon
In July of 2016, a team of developers led by Joseph Curtis competed in the TechHire Hackathon at the Tech Collective in Olneyville.

Our project, the "Providence Pothole Killer," was a demo web app (Node.js / Leaflet.js) showing one possible interface to visualize the Waze data.

We won the competition. (Hooray!) That code is available [here](https://github.com/toklok/pvdHack), in Joe's github repo.
